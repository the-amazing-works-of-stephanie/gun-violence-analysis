## Analysis of Gun Violence Throughout the World

Authors: Matthew Pohlhaus and Stephanie Shutter

Initial Steps: 
1. Gather data and form a hypothesis
- Gun violence statistics in USA
- Population in USA
- Gun violence statistics & population in 2-3 other countries (or maybe a bunch of other countries????)
- MAYBE stats on other violent non-gun related crimes??
2. Combine the data together into one big table 
3. Examine, graph, and make conclusions

Some data sources: 
- https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/
- https://github.com/jamesqo/gun-violence-data
- https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gun-ownership-by-country <- REALLY cool interactive graph
- https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/03/24/980838151/gun-violence-deaths-how-the-u-s-compares-to-the-rest-of-the-world
- https://dataunodc.un.org/data/homicide/Homicide%20rate%20by%20mechanisms (this seems like a lovely dataset with well organized data)

Notes: 
- In reviewing the worldpopulationreview.com link, the USA has the highest gun ownership rate 120.5 of ALL listed countries. The next highest is the Falkman Islands, with 62.1, but its population is only 3533! 
- So here we have a conundrum--do we use the Falkman Islands (62.1) with its small population + the third highest country listed, Yemen (52.8)? Or do we pick a country with a similar population size to the USA, such as Pakistan (225,199,937)? OR do we pick the highest country from each region (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania)?
