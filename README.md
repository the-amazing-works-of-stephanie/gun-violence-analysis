## Analysis of Gun Violence Throughout the World

Authors: Matthew Pohlhaus and Stephanie Shutter

Initial Steps: 
1. Gather data and form a hypothesis
- Gun homicide rates in all countries :D
- Gun ownership rates in all countries D:
2. Combine the data together into one big table OR compare the tables in some way
3. Examine, graph, and make conclusions
4. For ML part, could possibly analyze the 1999-2017 data we have and "predict" the homicide rate by firearm for 2018-2020, then find relevant tables for countries we wanna pinpoint (the ones with the highest homicide rate) and see how well our algorithm has predicted the rates. 

Some data sources: 
- https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/ <- USA-centric data--doesn't have statistics on any other country
- https://github.com/jamesqo/gun-violence-data <- also USA-centric
- https://theprint.in/india/india-sees-the-third-highest-firearm-related-deaths-in-the-world/274576/ <- this article states that India had the 3rd most gun-related deaths in 2016 according to http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/six-countries-americas-account-half-all-firearm-deaths
- https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gun-ownership-by-country <- REALLY cool interactive graph
- https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/03/24/980838151/gun-violence-deaths-how-the-u-s-compares-to-the-rest-of-the-world
- https://dataunodc.un.org/data/homicide/Homicide%20rate%20by%20mechanisms (this seems like a lovely dataset with well organized data)

There's a lot of information here, and from a LOT of different sources, so I think our highest priority should be choosing which data we're using and why. What is our hypothesis? What are we looking to learn? And most importantly, which of these data sets can tell us the most varied bit of information? (i.e. we probably don't want a graph that only has the country, year, and death rate--if there's more information, that's good!)

Notes: 
- In reviewing the worldpopulationreview.com link, the USA has the highest gun ownership rate 120.5 of ALL listed countries. The next highest is the Falkman Islands, with 62.1, but its population is only 3533! 
- So here we have a conundrum--do we use the Falkman Islands (62.1) with its small population + the third highest country listed, Yemen (52.8)? Or do we pick a country with a similar population size to the USA, such as Pakistan (225,199,937)? OR do we pick the highest country from each region (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania)?

Stephanie: I want to thank my stuffed dog, Neko, for taking the oh-so-important position of "rubber duck". I couldn't have done all this work without you providing silent judgement whenever I voiced a dumb idea.
